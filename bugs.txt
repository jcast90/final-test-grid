 For starters, I had trouble navigating their wordpress site. It took me 30 min before I realized the arrow on the front was a download button, I thought it was an arrow pointing down indicating that there was more content. Also, there was no way to return to the home page once on the inner pages. As far as the framework goes, it was also a little difficult to navigate and put together. There were a few bugs, for example, when trying to add the sticky aside, it wouldn't stick to the side of the page. Also, when adding the responsive nav, it would automatically set everything to the width of a phone. The grid wasn't very responsive either, I couldn't figure out what the breakpoints were. Everything just got squished. It was frustrating trying to build something with this framework. I feel like the concept was good, it just needed to be polished up a bit more or tested.
